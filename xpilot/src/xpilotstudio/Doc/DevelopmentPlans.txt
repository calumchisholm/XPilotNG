1. One editor for maps, ships, server config files...client config files, and
anything else that should be editable for Xpilot.

2. OS independent. Same software for both *NIX and Windows 9*/NT/2000.

3. Multiple document interface. Documents would each have its own set of tools for each
type of document.

4. Use OS clipboard for cutting, pasting..etc. Wishfull thinking....

5. Ability to test each item edited. Playtest maps. Preview ships. Etc.

6. Extendable capacity for server options / ship items / robot types.

************Map Editing***************
1:New Map Format:
The main XML tag to identify the type of map this is:
	<XPilotMap>

Next theres a tag listing the number of memory important blocks:
	<Featurecount bases="0" balls="3" checkpoints="0"/>

Followed by a closed set of tags listing all options:
	<GeneralOptions>
	<Option name="mapwidth" value="3500"/>
	<Option name="mapheight" value="3500"/>
	<Option name="mapname" value="New Map"/>
	<Option name="mapauthor" value="Your Name"/>
	...
	...
	</GeneralOptions>

Walls are then specified:
	<Walls>
	<Polygon x="205" y="3380" hidedges="0">
	<Offset x="16" y="-64"/>
	<Offset x="47" y="-29"/>
	<Offset x="35" y="30"/>
	<Offset x="-14" y="37"/>
	<Offset x="-22" y="41"/>
	<Offset x="-38" y="53"/>
	<Offset x="-41" y="-24"/>
	<Offset x="-26" y="-28"/>
	<Offset x="6" y="-25"/>
	<Offset x="20" y="-16"/>
	<Offset x="17" y="25" hidden="yes"/>
	</Polygon>
	</Walls>
	
	In the above example, the x and y attributes in the <Polygon> tag specify the
	starting coord for the polygon. The hidedges attribute specifies the number
	of edges that are hidden from collision detection. The user must ensure that these
	edges cannot possibly be intersected by players.
	The Offset attributes x and y specify the movement from the previous point to the
	next point of the Polygon. The hidden attribute specifies whether the edge created
	by this offset is hidden from collision detection.
	Hidden edges are not drawn by the Xpilot Client.
	The <Walls> tag is included to differentiate between these polygons and possible
	decoration polygons to be added later.

Treasure Balls, if any are desired, are then defined:
	<Ball x="112" y="3456" team="0"/>
	<Ball x="312" y="3430" team="0"/>
	<Ball x="121" y="3330" team="0"/>
	
	The attributes x, y & team specify the coordinates of the ball and the team #
	owning the ball.

Ball Area's & Targets are then defined:
	<BallArea team="0">
	<Polygon x="351" y="3394" hidedges="0">
	<Offset x="3" y="-59"/>
	<Offset x="46" y="-21"/>
	<Offset x="41" y="7"/>
	</Polygon>
	</BallArea>

	The <BallArea team="0"> or <BallTarget team="0"> tag is used in place of 
	the <Walls> tag in the definition for walls above. Other than that difference
	the definitions are the same.

The Bases are then defined:
	<Base x="39" y="3412" team="0" dir="32"/>
	<Base x="51" y="3373" team="0" dir="32"/>
	<Base x="91" y="3385" team="0" dir="32"/>

	The base attributes of x,y,team & dir specify the x,y coordinates of the base,
	the team owner of the base, and one of 128 possible directional orientations.

The Checkpoints are then defined:
	<Checkpoint x="17" y="3306"/>
	<Checkpoint x="43" y="3266"/>
	<Checkpoint x="154" y="3261"/>

	The attributes of x & y, specify the coordinates of the checkpoint.
	Checkpoints must be specified in the order in which they are desired.

Regions, which have been discussed and desired could be specified in the same format, as
walls above.
 
2: Need ability to save both map and thumbnail view as images. Preferably jpeg, bmp, png, etc.
All formats should be system independant: meaning you can save to any format from *NIX or Windows9*/NT/2K.

3: Versatile zooming features, such as zoom in/out, zoom by window, dynamic zoom, zoom all
and ability to move the screen center by dragging a box in the thumbnail view which shows the
current position.

4: Wouldn't it be nice if we could import say...dxf or dwg files? Of course this would
mean the files would have to contain only straight lines, unless theres some way to extend
the xpilot server to accept circles or arcs in the map, which isn't likely.

************Help***************
1. Html based help, so that only one set of help files is created, but is usable on any system
that can use HTML. These files then could also be placed on the 'net.
