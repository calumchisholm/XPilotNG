TODO

If you see a (free) task you would like to do, put your name under the task
and just do it. If your favourite feature is missing, go ahead and add a task 
for it.

Task:
  Implement the Gui_* methods in sdlgui.c. Most of those are probably easy
  to implement by just painting the appropriate image.
Developer:
  
Task:
  Implement the Gui_paint_polygon properly. According to OpenGL specs the
  polygons should be simple and convex. In xpilot polygons are simple but
  often non-convex, so this may require polygon tessellation. The GLU
  library provides the necessary functionality.
Developer:

Task:
  Implement radar painting. The most effective way would probably be
  to use similar strategy as the X client uses. The radar walls are
  painted to an image which is then painted to the screen.
Developer: baron

Task:
  Text/font handling. OpenGL does not provide any easy way to draw text.
  My propose is to use bitmaps for each character and implement a function
  that uses those bitmaps to draw text.
Developer: Colonel & Mara (whoever gets around to it first)

Task:
  Talk window. This task depends on the text/font handling task.
Developer:

Task:
  Message display. This task depends on the text/font handling task.
Developer:

Task:
  Score display. This task depends on the text/font handling task.
Developer:

Task:
  Scalefactor. This could be done with OpenGL's glScale but the rounding
  errors make the map change from frame to frame. If possible this effect
  should be minimized.
Developer:

Task:
  Windows support. The biggest thing here is to implement options.c and 
  Game_loop without using X.
Developer:

Task:
  Rewrite options.c so that it does not use X resources. This would be a 
  useful feature in the X client as well.
Developer: kps

Task:
  Add more tasks here.
