If you see a (free) task you would like to do, put your name under the task
and just do it. If your favourite feature is missing, go ahead and add a task 
for it.

Task:
  Implement the Gui_* methods in sdlgui.c. Most of those are probably easy
  to implement by just painting the appropriate image.
Developer:
  
Task:
  Implement the Gui_paint_polygon properly. According to OpenGL specs the
  polygons should be simple and convex. In xpilot polygons are simple but
  often non-convex, so this may require polygon tessellation. The GLU
  library provides the necessary functionality.
Developer:


Task:
  Scalefactor. This could be done with OpenGL's glScale but the rounding
  errors make the map change from frame to frame. If possible this effect
  should be minimized.
Developer:



Task:
  Meta interface in SDL, make it so that you can change to another server whilst in game (saves doing quit and restart).
Developer: colonel
