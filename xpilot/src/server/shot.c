     * Once upon a time, back in the "good old days" of XPilot, it was
     * relatively easy thing to remember the few keys needed to fly and shoot.
     * It was the day of Sopwith Camels biplanes, albeit triangular ones,
     * doing close to-the-death machine gun combat with other triangular
     * Red Barons, the hard vacuum of space whistling silently by as only
     * something that doesn't exist could do (this was later augmented by
     * artificial aural feedback devices on certain advanced hardware).
     *
     * Eventually the weapon designers came up with "smart" missiles, and
     * another key was added to the control board, causing one missile to
     * launch straight forwards from the front of the triangular ship.
     * Soon other types of missiles were added, including "heat" seekers,
     * and fast straight travelling "torpedoes" (hark, is that the sonorous
     * ping-ping-ping of sonar equipment I hear?).
     *
     * Then one day along came a certain fellow who thought, among other
     * things, that it would be neat to fire up to four missiles with one
     * key press, just so the enemy pilot would be scared witless by the
     * sudden appearance of four missiles hot on their tail.  To make things
     * fair these "mini" missiles would have the same total damage of a
     * normal missile, but would travel at the speed of a normal missile.
     *
     * However this fellow mused that simply launching all the missiles in
     * the same direction and from the same point would cause the missiles
     * to appear on top of each other.  Thus he added code to "spread" the
     * missiles out at various angular offsets from the ship.  Indeed the
     * angular offsets could be controlled using a spread modifier, and yet
     * more keys appeared on a now crowded control desk.
     *
     * Interestingly the future would see the same fellow adding a two seater
     * variant of the standard single seater ship, allowing one person
     * to concentrate on flying the ship, while another could flick through
     * out-of-date manuals searching for the right key combinations on
     * the now huge console which would launch four full nuclear slow-cluster
     * imploding mini super speed close spread torpedoes at the currently
     * targetted enemy, and then engage emergency thrust and shields before
     * the ominous looking tri-winged dagger ship recoiled at high velocity
     * into a rocky wall half way across the other side of the universe.
     *
     * Back to our story, and this same fellow was musing at the design of
     * multiple "mini" missiles, and noted that the angle of launch would
     * also require a different launch point on the ship (actually it was
     * the same position as if the front of the ship was rotated to point in
     * the direction of missile launch, mainly because it was easier to
     * write the launch/guidance computer software that way).
     *
     * Later, some artistically (or sadistically) minded person decided that
     * triangular ships just didn't look good (even though they were very
     * spatially dynamic, cheap and easy to build), and wouldn't it be just
     * fantastic if one could have a ship shaped like a banana!  Sensibly,
     * however, he restricted missiles and guns to the normal single frontal
     * launching point.
     *
     * A few weeks later, somebody else decided how visually pleasing it
     * would be if one could design where missiles could be fired from by
     * adding "missile rack" points on the ship.  Up to four racks were
     * available, and missiles would fire from exactly these points on the
     * ship.  Since one to four missiles could be fired in one go, the
     * combinations with various ship designs were numerous (16).
     *
     * What would happen if somebody fired four missiles in one go, from a
     * ship that only had three missile racks?  How about two missiles from
     * one with four racks?  Sadly the missile launch software hadn't been
     * designed to take this sort of thing into account, and incredibly the
     * original programmer wasn't notified until after First Customer Ship
     * [sic], the launch software only slightly modified by the ship
     * designer, who didn't know the first thing about launch acceleration
     * curves or electronic owner immunity fuse timers.
     *
     * Pilots found their missiles were being fired from random points and
     * in sometimes very odd directions, occasionally even destroying the
     * ship without trace, severely annoying the ship's owners and several
     * insurance underwriters.  Not soon after several ship designers were
     * mysteriously killed in a freak "accident" involving a stray nuclear
     * cluster bomb, and the remaining ship designers became very careful
     * to place missile racks and extra gun turrets well away from the
     * ship's superstructure.
     *
     * The original programmer who invented multiple "mini" spreading
     * missiles quickly decided to revisit his code before any "accidents"
     * came his way, and spent a good few hours making sure one couldn't
     * shoot oneself in the "foot", and that missiles where launched in some
     * reasonable and sensible directions based on the position of the
     * missile racks.
     *
     * 			How It Actually Works
     *			---------------------
     *
     * The first obstacle is getting the right number of missiles fired
     * from each combination of missile rack configurations;
     *
     *
     *		Minis	1	2	3	4
     * Racks
     *	1		1	2	3	4
     *
     *	2		1/-	1/1	2/1	2/2
     *			-/1		1/2
     *
     *	3		1/-/-	1/1/-	1/1/1	2/1/1
     *			-/1/-	-/1/1		1/2/1
     *			-/-/1	1/-/1		1/1/2
     *
     *	4		1/-/-/-	1/1/-/-	1/1/1/-	1/1/1/1
     *			-/1/-/-	-/1/1/-	-/1/1/1
     *			-/-/1/-	-/-/1/1	1/-/1/1
     *			-/-/-/1 1/-/-/1	1/1/-/1
     *
     * To read; For example with 2 Minis and 3 Racks, the first round will
     * fire 1/1/-, which is one missile from left and middle racks.  The
     * next time fired will be -/1/1; middle and right, next fire is
     * 1/-/1; left and right.  Next time goes to the beggining state.
     *
     * 			Comment Point 1
     *			---------------
     *
     * The *starting* rack number for each salvo cycles through the number
     * of missiles racks.  This is stored in the player variable
     * 'pl->missile_rack', and is only incremented after each salvo (not
     * after each mini missile is fired).  This value is used to initialise
     * 'rack_no', which stores the current rack that missiles are fired from.
     *
     * 'on_this_rack' is computed to be the number of missiles that will be
     * fired from 'rack_no', and 'r' is used as a counter to this value.
     *
     * 'racks_left' count how many unused missiles racks are left on the ship
     * in this mini missile salvo.
     *
     * 			Comment Point 2
     *			---------------
     *
     * When 'r' reaches 'on_this_rack' all the missiles have been fired for
     * this rack, and the next rack should be used.  'rack_no' is incremented
     * modulo the number of available racks, and 'racks_left' is decremented.
     * At this point 'on_this_rack' is recomputed for the next rack, and 'r'
     * reset to zero.  Thus initially these two variables are both zero, and
     * 'rack_no' is one less, such that these variables can be computed inside
     * the loop to make the code simpler.
     *
     * The computation of 'on_this_rack' is as follows;  Given that there
     * are M missiles and R racks remaining;
     *
     *	on_this_rack = int(M / R);	(ie. round down to lowest int)
     *
     * Then;
     *
     *	(M - on_this_rack) / (R - 1) < (M / R).
     *
     * That is, the number of missiles fired on the next rack will be
     * more precise, and trivially can be seen that when R is 1, will
     * give an exact number of missiles to fire on the last rack.
     *
     * In the code 'M' is (minis - i), and 'R' is racks_left.
     *
     *			Comment Point 3
     *			---------------
     *
     * In order that multiple missiles fired from one rack do not conincide,
     * each missile has to be "spread" based on the number of missiles
     * fired from this rack point.
     *
     * This is computed similar to the wide shot code;
     *
     *	angle = (N - 1 - 2 * i) / (N - 1)
     *
     * Where N is the number of shots/missiles to be fired, and i is a counter
     * from 0 .. N-1.
     *
     * 		i	0	1	2	3
     * N
     * 1		0
     * 2		1	-1
     * 3		1	0	-1
     * 4		1	0.333	-0.333	-1
     *
     * In this code 'N' is 'on_this_rack'.
     *
     * Also the position of the missile rack from the center line of the
     * ship (stored in 'side') has a linear effect on the angle, such that
     * a point farthest from the center line contributes the largest angle;
     *
     * angle += (side / SHIP_SZ)
     *
     * Since the eventual 'angle' value used in the code should be a
     * percentage of the unmodified launch angle, it should be ranged between
     * -1.00 and +1.00, and thus the first angle is reduced by 33% and the
     * second by 66%.

/*
 * The new ball movement code since XPilot version 3.4.0 as made
 * by Bretton Wade.  The code was submitted in context diff format
 * by Mark Boyns.  Here is a an excerpt from a post in
 * rec.games.computer.xpilot by Bretton Wade dated 27 Jun 1995:
 *
 * If I'm not mistaken (not having looked very closely at the code
 * because I wasn't sure what it was trying to do), the original move_ball
 * routine was trying to model a Hook's law spring, but squared the
 * deformation term, which would lead to exagerated behavior as the spring
 * stretched too far. Not really a divide by zero, but effectively
 * producing large numbers.
 *
 * When I coded up the spring myself, I found that I could recreate the
 * effect by using a VERY strong spring. This can be defeated, however, by
 * damping. Specifically, If you compute the critical damping factor, then
 * you could have the cable always be the correct length. This makes me
 * wonder how to decide when the cable snaps.
 *
 * I chose a relatively strong spring, and a small damping factor, to make
 * for a nice realistic bounce when you grab at the treasure. It also
 * gives a fairley close approximation to the "normal" feel of the
 * treasure.
 *
 * I modeled the cable as having zero mass, or at least insignificant mass
 * as compared to the ship and ball. This greatly simplifies the math, and
 * leads to the conclusion that there will be no change in velocity when
 * the cable breaks. You can check this by integrating the momentum along
 * the cable, and the ship or ball.
 *
 * If you assume that the cable snaps in the middle, then half of the
 * potential energy goes to each object attached. However, as you said, the
 * total momentum of the system cannot change. Because the weight of the
 * cable is small, the vast majority of the potential energy will become
 * heat. I've had two physicists verify this for me, and they both worked
 * really hard on the problem because they found it interesting.
 *
 * End of post.
 *
 * Changes since then:
 *
 * Comment from people was that the string snaps too soon.
 * Changed the value (max_spring_ratio) at which the string snaps
 * from 0.25 to 0.30.  Not sure if that helps enough, or too much.
