/*
 * We would like to support several different robot types.
 * Each robot type is defined by one name and is accessed
 * by several functions or methods.
 * The name is used to enable configuration files to
 * specify which robot type to use for which robot name.
 * The functions are:
 *
 *    1) The global initialization function for this specific robot type.
 *       It is called once at startup to initialise a structure with
 *       function pointers to the robot type action routines.
 *
 *    2) The next round function, which is called only once per round
 *       to allow the robot type adjust type generic parameters.
 *
 *    3) The initialization function to enable robot type
 *       specific adjustments and possible memory allocation
 *       of private data structures for one specific robot instance.
 *       This function will be called with an extra string argument.
 *       The string argument may contain robot type specific
 *       configuration data, like attack and defend mode.
 *       Each robot type is free to define the format
 *       for this string as it sees fit.  But when this string
 *       is empty the robot type initialization code will
 *       have to provide suitable default configuration values.
 *
 *    4) The go home function which is called whenever the robot
 *       is placed at its homebase.
 *
 *    5) The playing function which gets called each loop.
 *       The programming challenge here is to implement
 *       different characters per robot, while at the
 *       same time not calculating 'everything' every
 *       time this function is called.  i.e., try to give
 *       the robot some long term goals which are only
 *       recalculated once every couple of seconds or so.
 *
 *    6) The war function which is called when the robot declares war.
 *       This function takes an extra killer argument, which is
 *       the player id of the player the robot has declared war against.
 *       If this id equals NO_ID then the routine should reset the war state.
 *
 *    7) The war_on_player function returns the id of the player
 *       who the robot is in a state of war with.
 *       If the robot is not in war with another player
 *       then this function should return NO_ID.
 *
 *    8) The message function can accept any possible commands to the robot.
 *       The suggestion here is that if you plan to let the robot type
 *       be controllable by messages that you give feedback to all
 *       of the players what commands the robot has accepted.
 *
 *    9) The cleanup function should free any allocated resources
 *       for this specific robot instance.
 *
 * The recommended practice is to define your new robot types
 * in a separate file and to only declare your robot type
 * specific initialisation function prototype in robot.c and add one
 * function pointer to the robot_type_setups array.
