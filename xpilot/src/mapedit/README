The original author Aaron Averill can no longer be contacted.
He donated xmapedit to XPilot <xpilot@xpilot.org> provided that his
name remains clearly recognizable as the principal author of xmapedit.
The changes made by William Docter, Robert Templeman, and Jarrod Miller were
donated to XPilot provided that xmapedit remains free and the source code
available to the public.
