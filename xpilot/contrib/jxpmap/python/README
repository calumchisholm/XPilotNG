Python version of the map editor. Not ready yet but can be used for
modifying maps if you know what you're doing. Requires Python 2.1 or
newer, python-gtk and python-xml. Based on the Java version so some
"literally" translated code may look a bit odd.
You'll need to edit config.py before starting the program.
Start with "python MainFrame.py mapname".
