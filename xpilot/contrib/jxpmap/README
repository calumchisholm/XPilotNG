jXPMap - A map editor for the new XPilot map format

Copyright © 2001 by Juha Lindström

1. Overview

This is a simple map editor for editing the XML based map files 
used in the new xpilot server by Uoti Urpala. The new server
allows the map to be defined in terms of arbitrary polygons and
the new client supprts map-specific textures, so the new maps can
be visually a lot nicer compared to the old maps. This editor is
supposed to support all the new stuff so that people could easily
experiment with the new map format.

2. Requirements

The editor is implemented in java and it requires the Java Runtime 
Environment (JRE) 1.3. It might also work with 1.2 but I haven't 
tested that. In order to compile it you need also a java compiler, 
so if you wan't to use this editor and have nothing java related 
installed, you'd better download the whole Java2 SDK 1.3 from 
http://java.sun.com/j2se.

The editor uses JAXP 1.0.1 XML parser from Sun. You can download it
from http://java.sun.com/xml.

3. Installation

Before you can use the editor you need to build it. In the current 
directory give a command like the following:

% javac -classpath .:<jaxp-dir>/parser.jar:<jaxp-dir>/jaxp.jar org/xpilot/jxpmap/*.java

Substitute <jaxp-dir> with the directory you installed JAXP to.

After the compilation is finished you should be able to run it with
command like:

% java -classpath .:<jaxp-dir>/parser.jar:<jaxp-dir>/jaxp.jar org.xpilot.jxpmap.MainFrame
