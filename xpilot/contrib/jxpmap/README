jXPMap - A map editor for the new XPilot map format

Copyright © 2001 by Juha Lindström

1. Overview

This is a simple map editor for editing the XML based map files 
used in the new xpilot server by Uoti Urpala. The new server
allows the map to be defined in terms of arbitrary polygons and
the new client supprts map-specific textures, so the new maps can
be visually a lot nicer compared to the old maps. This editor is
supposed to support all the new stuff so that people could easily
experiment with the new map format.

2. Requirements

The editor is implemented in java and it requires the Java Runtime 
Environment (JRE) 1.4. If you want to start it directly from its
web page (http://xpilot.sourceforge.net/jxpmap) you need to have
Java Web Start installed. In windows Java Web Start is automatically 
installed when you install JRE. However, on linux etc. you (usually) 
have to manually install Java Web Start.

3. Trying it out

If you have Java Web Start installed, the easiest way to test the editor 
is to go to http://xpilot.sourceforge.net/jxpmap and click the 
"Start jXPMap" link. If you don't have it you can just download the
jxpmap.jar file and run it with java -jar jxpmap.jar.

4. Compiling (written by kps)

To create the jxpmap.jar you need the Apache Ant build tool, a BeanShell jar
and a kunststoff jar file. You can get the beanshell.jar from www.beanshell.org
and the kunststoff.jar from http://incors.org/archive/. Copy the bsh-2.0b4.jar
and kunststoff.jar into the xpilot/contrib/jxpmap directory. Change the
build.xml file so that the filename of the bsh jar matches that what you have
(e.g. I had to change bsh-2.0b1.jar to bsh-2.0b4.jar). Now to make the
jxpmap.jar file you issue the unix command:

ant jar
