	* TODO: Wrote a few things we need to do for xpilot ng.

2004-08-26 22:05  kps

	* src/client/NT/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in: changes due to added
	  files.

2004-08-26 21:41  kps

	* src/client/NT/: paintdata.h, xpaint.h, xpclient_x11.h: Added some

	* doc/man/: xpilot-ng-replay.man, xpilot-ng-sdl.man,
	  xpilot-ng-server.man, xpilot-ng-x11.man: Generated new man pages
	  due to new options.

2004-08-25 00:26  kps

	* contrib/TkXpInterface/.cvsignore: ignore tkxpinterface stuff

2004-08-25 00:22  kps

	* src/client/x11/.cvsignore: added cvsignore file.

2004-08-25 00:18  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, play.c, server.h: New server option
	  useDebris aka useSparks which toggles creation of debris.
	  Default is true.

2004-08-24 22:06  kps

2004-08-23 14:08  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: When ship bounces, remove constantSpeed from
	  player velocity vector before calculating the new velocity
	  vector. This way you can't accumulate the constantSpeed by
	  sliding along a wall.

2004-08-23 13:54  kps

	* src/server/player.c: Don't lose items when pausing.  The reason
	  this bug/feature appeared was that Player_death_reset is now
	  called when someone pauses. That change was done so that player
	  would be properly reset when pausing so that e.g. player would
	  stop shooting etc.

2004-08-17 20:55  kps

	* src/client/sdl/sdlgui.c: Added option texturedBalls for sdl
	  client.

2004-08-16 20:19  kps

	* src/server/: sched.c, sched.h: Removed some unused functions from
	  sched.c

2004-08-15 22:18  kps

	* src/server/shot.c: Don't use sprintf where _f versions of
	  Set_message functions can be used.

2004-08-15 19:56  kps

	* src/server/: frame.c, map.c, map.h, server.h, update.c,
	  wormhole.c, xp2map.c, xpmap.c: Removed broken support for
	  temporary wormholes.	I've never seen temporary wormholes used
	  anyway.

2004-08-14 12:40  kps

	* src/server/: asteroid.c, map.c, map.h, robotdef.c, server.h,
	  walls.c, xpmap.c: Robots now use shape_is_inside to determine
	  what is empty space on map.  This is done by using a new shape
	  'filled_wire' which is the shape of a map block.  Removed
	  'SPACE_BLOCKS' which was a bitmap with a bit for each type of
	  block which should be considered space (this is not needed since
	  this can be done with polygon methods). Removed from map.h
	  definitions of block bits ('SPACE_BIT' etc).

2004-08-05 19:37  kps

	* src/server/update.c: Throat contributed some code to reset warped
	  bit of players when they exit a wormhole. This means one can warp
	  more than once per life now, whee!!!

2004-07-15 16:03  kps

	* src/server/xpmap.c: Try to avoid "Bad homebase index" error in
	  block based clients.	If multiple bases are in the area of the
	  same block on a polygon map, we line up the extra bases close to
	  the origin of the map.  Note that bases will not be in the order
	  the block based client expects, so bases might have wrong team
	  number or player name shown in block based clients. This could
	  probably be fixed by sorting the bases in int world->bases array.

2004-07-15 14:25  kps

	* src/common/pack.h: instruments.useBlockProtocol became
	  instruments.blockProtocol.

2004-07-15 00:18  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, default.c, guimap.c,
	  guiobjects.c, messages.c, paintmap.c, paintradar.c, xpaint.c,
	  xpilot.c, NT/winXXPilot.c, sdl/radar.c, sdl/sdlgui.c: Client
	  option teamShotSize works now. Apparently it was broken somewhere
	  between xpilot 4.0.0 and xpilot 4.5.4. Teamshots now honor
	  showNastyShots option.  Renamed fields in instruments_t and some
	  client variables (shot_size, teamshot_size, spark_size, ...) to
	  have same names as the relevant options.

2004-07-13 22:38  kps

	* src/client/: client.h, guiobjects.c, xdefault.c, xpaint.h: Jimmy
	  Andersson contributed code that paints round shots instead of
	  rectangles.  Max size of shots and teamshots is now 20 (was 8).
	  Moved showNastyShots into instruments_t.

2004-07-13 11:44  kps

	* lib/maps/: polybloods.xp2, polybloods7.xp2: Removed some useless
	  options and data.

2004-07-10 21:59  kps

	* src/client/textinterface.c: 'R' is not more a privileged command
	  in textinterface (used to set robotnum).

2004-07-10 17:31  darelcullen

	* BUGS: Added 2 new bugs :(

2004-07-06 01:42  kps

	* lib/maps/: polybloods.xp2, polybloods7.xp2: slightly less powered
	  settings afterburnerpower 1.1 ballconnectorspringconstant 1650

2004-07-05 19:17  kps

	* lib/maps/: polybloods.xp2, polybloods7.xp2: Set
	  playerwallfriction to 0.8 and wallbouncefueldrainmult to 0.1.

2004-07-04 21:40  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: Changed constant C2 in uau's wallbounces to
	  1-playerwallbrake.  (The change in speed parallel to wall during
	  wall bounce is MIN(C1*perpendicular_change, C2*parallel_speed)).

2004-07-04 20:48  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods.xp2: Changed playerwallbrake to 0.5 now that
	  we have mara's or uau's wallbounces.

2004-07-04 20:22  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods.xp2: New default settings in polybloods.xp2.
	  Map version is now 8.3.  afterburnerpowermult 1.2
	  ballconnectorspringconstant 1800 ballradius 10 constantspeed 0.5

2004-07-04 20:14  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods.xp2: Sorted options alphabetically.

2004-07-04 20:08  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods7.xp2: New "standard" settings: constantspeed
	  0.5 afterburnerpowermult 1.2 ballradius 10
	  ballconnectorspringconstant 1800

2004-07-04 19:58  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods7.xp2: Removed some more unnecessary options.

	* lib/maps/polybloods7.xp2: Sorted options alphabetically.

2004-07-04 19:36  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods7.xp2: Removed some unnecessary options.

2004-07-04 18:47  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods7.xp2: Removed mapdata option (server can
	  create the blocks from polygons).  Made dataurl option
	  polybloods.xpd (opengl has problems with rtc2.xpd).

2004-07-04 14:53  kps

	* lib/maps/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, polybloods7.xp2: Added
	  polybloods v7 map to distro. Main difference to v8 is that v7 did
	  not have rounded or modified walls.

2004-07-03 22:58  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, server.h, walls.c: New wall bounce code.
	  New option playerWallFriction (0.5 by default).  New option
	  maraWallBounce (temporary option; true by default).  Mara's wall
	  bounces work like this: Vtangent2 =
	  (1-Vnormal1/Vtotal1*wallfriction)*Vtangent1 Uau's wall bounces
	  work like this: change the parallel one by
	  MIN(C1*perpendicular_change, C2*parallel_speed) if you assume the
	  wall has a coefficient of friction C1.

2004-06-30 01:15  kps

	* src/client/netclient.c: OOPS! Commited some wrong code in
	  netclient.c in revision 1.92.  Revision 1.93 is the same as 1.91.

2004-06-30 01:11  kps

	* configure, configure.ac, src/client/netclient.c: Define some
	  extra CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to use in FreeBSD.

2004-06-29 21:28  darelcullen

	* ChangeLog: Updated Changelog

2004-06-23 13:28  kps

	* src/server/shot.c: Make option constantSpeed affect shots'
	  initial velocity.  This lets you accelerate shots nicely.

2004-06-21 19:35  kps

	* src/server/: alliance.c, asteroid.c, cannon.c, cmdline.c,
	  collision.c, command.c, contact.c, event.c, frame.c, item.c,
	  map.c, map.h, metaserver.c, netserver.c, play.c, player.c,

	  server.h, ship.c, shot.c, target.c, teamcup.c, treasure.c,
	  tuner.c, update.c, walls.c, wormhole.c, xpmap.c: Renamed
	  functions that access world map objects. Names were changed like
	  Bases() -> Base_by_index(), Fuels() -> Fuel_by_index(). These
	  functions now return NULL instead of accessing memory outside the
	  allocated array if an invalid index is given. Also changed
	  Players() to Player_by_index() and changed it from a function to
	  an inline function.

2004-06-21 00:42  kps

	* lib/maps/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, dragon-1.0.xp2: Added
	  Throat's innovative Dragon map to the distro. Good work Throat!!!

2004-06-20 23:26  kps

	* src/: client/client.c, client/default.c, client/netclient.c,
	  client/netclient.h, server/cmdline.c, server/netserver.c,
	  server/sched.c, server/serverconst.h: Support FPS up to 255 on
	  both client and server. Limit 255 comes from the fps request
	  packet which uses a byte to specify FPS.  Changed client define
	  MAX_SUPPORTED_FPS to 255 and added server define MAX_SERVER_FPS.

2004-06-20 19:34  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, player.c, server.h, treasure.c: New
	  server option by Karsten Siegmund (Throat): specialBallTeam.
	  Balls that belong to this team are 'special' balls that score
	  against all other teams.

2004-06-15 00:39  kps

	* lib/maps/teamcup.xp: Removed numberofrounds and framespersecond
	  options.

2004-06-14 22:39  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, join.c, sdl/gameloop.c, sdl/gameloop_x.c,
	  sdl/sdlevent.c: SDL client now has support for maxMouseTurnsPS
	  option.  In gameloop.c, continue if select is interrupted;

2004-06-12 17:44  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, default.c, join.c, netclient.c:
	  Added Client_check_pointer_move_interval(). If calculates how
	  long time to wait to next send interval in addition to sending a
	  mouse steering packet if that is needed; this is done if
	  maxMouseTurnsPS option is > 0.

2004-06-09 01:29  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, default.c, join.c, netclient.c,
	  xevent.c: New implementation of maxMouseTurnsPs.

2004-06-07 22:18  juhal

2004-06-03 21:24  kps

	* src/server/metaserver.c: Don't send server status (Server_info())
	  to meta server. Other cleanups.

2004-06-03 19:07  kps

	* src/server/: metaserver.c, netserver.c, server.c, server.h: More
	  metaserver.c cleanups.  Changed serverTime global to
	  serverStartTime.

2004-06-03 17:50  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, metaserver.c, server.h: Added option
	  metaUpdateMaxSize (which doesn't work in this revision).  In
	  metaserver.c, cleaned up for-loop where we calculate number of
	  available homebases per team.

2004-06-01 20:57  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, event.c, paint.c, xdefault.c,

	  src/client/NT/Makefile.in, src/client/NT/XPilot.ini,
	  src/client/NT/XPilot.shp, src/common/xpconfig.h: All platforms
	  now use shipshapes.txt as the default shipshape file.  Removed
	  XPilot.ini and XPilot.shp because in NG xpilotrc.txt and
	  shipshapes.txt are used, even in MFC client.

2004-05-31 15:23  kps

	* lib/shipshapes.txt: Added Erik's (virus') and Flower's ships, a
	  few ships from the XPilot.shp file, removed a broken ship.

2004-05-31 14:33  maximan

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, server.h, walls.c: removed turnqueue,
	  buggy.

	  Renamed FIND_NAME_WIDTH to Check_name_string and added check for
	  NULL in it.

2004-05-30 14:29  maximan

	* src/client/sdl/sdlgui.c: maxCharsInNames works now for
	  mines,players and bases TODO: consider implementing it for lock

2004-05-30 14:05  kps

	* src/client/client.c: Copy nick name to id string in other
	  structure. Currently needed for SDLclient.

2004-05-30 01:35  kps

	* src/server/rank.c: Encode '<', '>', '&', '\'', '"' in html and
	  xml files.  Bump rank file version to 1.0.

2004-05-30 00:34  kps

	* src/client/guiobjects.c: Set default manyLivesColor to 0.

2004-05-30 00:16  kps

	* src/client/: join.c, xpaint.c: Repaint score table whenever it
	  changes. Delay max 1 second in select() in input loop.

2004-05-29 22:32  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, paint.c, paint.h, record.c,
	  record.h, xpaint.c, sdl/sdlpaint.c: Moved common stuff related to
	  frame painting into Paint_frame_start().

2004-05-29 22:00  kps

	* src/common/portability.h: Moved windows gettimeofday()
	  implementation to common/portability.h.  Make a preprocessor
	  error if we don't have gettimeofday().

2004-05-29 20:47  kps

	* src/client/xevent.c: Completed separating x_event() and
	  win_xevent().

2004-05-29 20:39  kps

	* src/client/xevent.c: Start to separate x_event() and win_event().

2004-05-29 20:01  kps

	  sdl/sdlevent.c: Moved windows gettimeofday() implementation to
	  common/portability.h.  Make a preprocessor error if we don't have
	  gettimeofday().

2004-05-29 19:32  kps

	* src/replay/xp-replay.h: Use xpcommon.h instead of a lot of other
	  includes.

2004-05-29 13:49  kps

	* src/client/: default.c, join.c, netclient.h, xevent.c, xevent.h,
	  sdl/gameloop.c, sdl/gameloop_x.c, sdl/sdlevent.c: Removed mara's

2004-05-28 16:20  kps

	* src/client/: guimap.c, xpaint.h: Use FIND_NAME_WIDTH when
	  painting bases.

2004-05-28 15:23  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, default.c, xpaint.h: New option
	  maxCharsInNames allows you to limit number of characters painted
	  in names of ships and on bases (could be extended to mines and
	  stuff later).  This allows you to print only a few chars of
	  insane nicks like MWMWMWMWWMMWWMW.

2004-05-28 11:48  kps

	* src/server/: object.h, update.c: Bugfix, now visibility is
	  updated also for non-active (e.g. paused, waiting) player.
	  Previously enemy ships could sometimes be invisible when e.g.
	  waiting.  This could previously be reproduced by running the
	  server with xpilot-ng-server -noQuit -map polybloods.xp2
	  +restrictrobots -robots 7 -rawmode and waiting until a few robots
	  had joined and then join (being in waiting state); then enemy
	  robots would be invisible.  In visibility_t canSee becomes bool.

2004-05-28 11:44  kps

	* src/server/frame.c: Trivial changes.

2004-05-27 17:06  kps

	* src/: client/client.h, client/default.c, common/pack.h: New
	  option blockProtocol can be used to force use of old protocol
	  when joining polygon servers. Useful for testing and nostalgia.

2004-05-26 22:19  juhal

	* src/client/oalaudio.c: better algorithms for sound source

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog Updated

2004-05-25 19:57  kps

	* README, configure, configure.ac, doc/man/xpilot-ng-replay.man,
	  doc/man/xpilot-ng-sdl.man, doc/man/xpilot-ng-server.man,
	  doc/man/xpilot-ng-x11.man, src/common/version.h: Version is now
	  4.6.5.  Changes compared to 4.6.4:

	  Common: - shipshape bug that could crash server or client or
	  allow bad shapes fixed

	  Client:

	  - bug fixed in xpilotrc parsing, e.g. in 4.6.4 this xpilotrc line
	  could not   be parsed properly:   xpilot.msg2:#=[#t|2|/team
	  4|/team 2] - SDL client fixes: quit button works on windows,
	  configure menu fix - xp5 style OpenAL sound support

	  Server:

	  - "shots from empty space" bug fixed by uau - server ranking
	  related changes: stats command can now show stats   of players
	  not playing (requires giving whole nick to stats command),
	  logout messages in rank webpage now work even after server
	  restart

2004-05-25 13:34  maximan

	* src/client/sdl/: glwidgets.c, glwidgets.h: changes to intchooser
	  and doublechooser widgets tap (button 2) on doublechoosers should
	  give 0.01 now always intchooser widgets scrolling function from
	  button 1 press should be more easy to use

2004-05-24 19:13  kps

	* src/server/rank.h: Rank_nuke_score is gone.

2004-05-24 17:17  kps

	* src/server/: command.c, rank.c: Stats command now allows
	  abbreviated nicks for players that are currently on the server.
	  Removed nuke command. Proper implementation would be something
	  like /setscore or /setstats command.

2004-05-23 21:24  juhal

	* src/client/oalaudio.c: removed some cleanup calls (on linux)
	  which caused hang/segfault

2004-05-23 20:47  darelcullen

	* src/client/xinit.c: oops forgot to check dpy when calling Change
	  pointer control

2004-05-23 17:38  kps

	* src/server/shot.c: Make dropped mines be affected by gravity.

2004-05-23 17:37  kps

	* src/server/option.c: Add some more warnings about obsolete
	  options.

2004-05-23 00:52  uau

	* src/server/event.c: Reset player state properly when pausing.

2004-05-23 00:40  kps

	* src/server/shot.c: Added Player_can_place_mine() inline function.
	  Note that previously players could lay mines while phased if
	  shieldedMining is true. Player_can_place_mine() doesn't allow
	  that.

2004-05-22 23:47  kps

	* src/server/shot.c: Added Player_can_fire_shot().

2004-05-22 22:36  kps

	  Get_player_by_name() when kicking players in text interface.

2004-05-22 00:36  kps

	* src/server/robotdef.c: New Wrap_length_min() to make code a bit
	  nicer looking and more efficient.  Use it in
	  Robot_default_play_check_map().

2004-05-21 21:52  kps

	* src/server/: command.c, rank.c, rank.h: Make stats command work
	  for players who aren't playing at the moment.  Change makes it
	  necessary to type the whole player nick to get the stats,
	  previously one could specify the player by an unique substring of
	  the nick.

2004-05-21 19:23  kps

	* src/client/option.c: Print warning for valid looking xpilotrc
	  lines that lack a colon.  Removed old Parse_xpilotrc_line().

2004-05-21 17:27  kps

	* src/server/: event.c, rank.c, rank.h: Remove
	  Rank_set_logout_message(). Instead of setting the logout message
	  in miscellaneous places we determine what logout message to use
	  at the time we are saving the webpage.

2004-05-21 01:02  kps

	* lib/maps/polybloods.xp2, lib/maps/sadistic_bastard_v2.xp2,

	  option from 0 to "0", added an assert that should catch such
	  mistakes.

2004-05-20 22:13  uau

	  implement essentially the same functionality in another way soon

2004-05-20 18:41  kps

	* src/client/option.c: New implementation of Parse_xpilotrc_line,
	  which doesn't use strtok().  The old implementation was buggy,
	  e.g. it could not handle this line correctly:
	  xpilot.msg2:#=[#t|2|/team 4|/team 2]

2004-05-20 16:02  darelcullen

	* src/client/sdl/sdlevent.c: Quit button fix.

2004-04-28 02:09  uau

	  (Cluster).

	  "Up-arrow history for talk causes a crash in 454 and ng ( and
	  maybe xp5) on linux with some fonts because XTextWidth may return
	  zero.  For example I use the SGI habefix  font on linux and it
	  causes this."

2004-04-20 13:31  kps

	* src/client/option.c: Limit value to range [min, max] instead of

	* src/server/: contact.c, frame.c, laser.c, netserver.c, robot.c,
	  server.h, target.c, treasure.c, update.c: Fix formatting string
	  related bug.	Set_message and Set_player_message now works as
	  before, they don't take a format string. Set_message_f and
	  Set_player_message_f take a format string.  Note that the format
	  string must always be specifed in the code, that is the user
	  should never be allowed to specify the format string, which can
	  happen in a call like this: Set_message_f(msg);

	* src/client/sdl/: glwidgets.c, glwidgets.h, radar.c, sdlinit.c,
	  sdlpaint.c: Confmenu now starts with online color indicators,
	  click the colored square and it changes into a color setup widget
	  (roughly 4 lines high)

	  Now the confmenu is persistant from start 'til finish since there
	  is some serious bug with closing it =( couldn't find what was
	  going on.  Good side is that the cnf menu now remembers its
	  position (i.e. scroll position) and wich colors were edited this
	  session (their widgets are still expanded) Bad side is that the
	  entire conf menu is persistant in memory, and uses up alot of
	  texture space =( Atleast *I* can't make it crash now, but the
	  trick to crash it seems diff erent between machines (col's method
	  didn't crash it on my comp, but on my comp it started crapping
	  stuff up if a message appeared while confmenu was up, and I
	  closed with the button)

	  player could not join that team anyway.

2004-01-21 23:09  kps

	* src/server/: frame.c, netserver.c, netserver.h, score.c: Changed

2004-01-21 22:18  kps

	* src/server/frame.c: Trivial change to reduce number of arguments

	* src/server/: object.h, play.c, player.c, update.c, walls.c:
	  Removed warped field from player structure (was an own hack). Now
	  server gets a false assertion if anything hits a wormhole.

2004-01-20 19:04  kps

	* src/client/colors.c: Values 4 or 8 for maxColors are allowed but

	* src/: client/netclient.c, common/pack.h, server/connection.h,

	* src/client/sdl/: glwidgets.c, glwidgets.h, radar.c, sdlinit.c,
	  sdlpaint.c, sdlpaint.h: well an earlyexample conf menu. only does
	  ints,doubles and bools atm.  (just goes through the options list
	  with Option_by_index()) Doesn't save though since I'm tired and
	  can't find the save functions in the new option code...  btw it
	  launches by pressing mousebutton 2 in the window (missing radar
	  and scorelist) and disappears teh same way. (just because it is
	  easy to test that way) Lots of work remains ofcourse, like making
	  the widgets more pleasing to the eye.  Atm, children to widgets
	  can't paint outside the widgets borders unless they disable
	  scissor test, the widget itself however for the moment can.  The
	  reason ebing scorelist and radar aren't properly implemented
	  GLWidgets, so their borders are painted outside their
	  'boundaries' as of yet.

	  pressing mousebutton 1 on radar or scorelist will raise them,
	  button 2 will push them to the backgrond. (not extremely useful,
	  but just to show it works, possibly useful somewhere else
	  sometime ;) /virus

	  Changes: -removed the 2 upside-down bases -changed team 4
	  wallcolor to be a bit more yellowish -changed wall thickness to 1
	  pixel (from 2) -added false kineticenergyfueldrain option to get
	  rid of what  Mara calls "nofuel bug": that you get hit by fast
	  bullets when	you appear shielded at your base, draining all your
	  fuel, leaving  you floating, dying upon crashing into the nearest
	  wall.

	* lib/maps/polybloods.xp2: Version 4 of the polybloods map, still

	* lib/maps/polybloods.xp2: Version 3 of the polybloods map, with 10
	  bases.  Can be found also at
	  http://www.hut.fi/~ksoderbl/xpilot/maps/polybloods10v3.xp2

	  The v2 and v3 polybloods maps were created by taking a normal
	  teamcup map, adding a few of the new server options and the 2
	  extra bases, and then using Uau's mapconvert.py. In v2, walls
	  were moved "inwards" 96 clicks (1.5 pixels), in v3, they were
	  moved inwards 128 clicks (2 pixels). This was done by using the
	  wall shrink hack in the python script. Ball radius was set to 9
	  (default 10). The ball target areas were enlargened by one pixel
	  to all sides.

	  In v3, teamZeroPausing and team 0 bases are removed and the
	  baselessPausing feature is used. Also the new pausedFPS and
	  waitingFPS options are used instead of
	  fullFramerate/allowViewing.

	  false on shieldless maps (Blood's Music), to prevent the "nofuel

	  fast bullets while still shielded and then have no fuel left,
	  leaving you floating into the nearest wall.

	* src/client/messages.c: Two improvements in ball message scan: 1.
	  Ignore warnings sent by players of other teams even if they
	  are sent especially to your team.	Example: team 2 member
	  writes message "4: BALL" it will not be scanned.  2. Scan all
	  messages sent by your team members, even if they are	  not sent
	  specifically to your team.	 Example: someone in your team just
	  writes "safe" it will be scanned.

2003-07-08 12:04  kps

	* src/server/command.c: Added code into name matching function
	  Get_player_by_name() so that if the given string matches exactly
	  the beginning of only one nick, then that player is returned,
	  even if the given string would be a substring of some other nick.
	  The idea is that if we have players Alpha and Beta then if we
	  write a message

	  a: hi!

	  it will go to Alpha. The substring matching part that comes last
	  in the function Get_player_by_name() is mostly useful if two
	  players nicks have a common first part, we can match on the
	  second part.	E.g. if we have players OpticalMouse and OpticalCop
	  we can do

	  mo: hello

	  and the message will go to OpticalMouse. With the 4.5.4 matching
	  code you would have had to write

	  opticalm: hello

	  Same goes for server commands.

2003-07-08 11:56  kps

	* src/server/netserver.c: Added [*server reply*] to server reply if
	  talk message matching failed.  This is so that the message would
	  appear among the talk message, where the player expects to see a

	  will just reply that robots don't have ranking stats (which could

	  Conditionally include inttypes.

2003-06-19 00:17  kps

	* configure.ac, src/common/xpcommon.h: Autoconf checks added for
	  VMS headers. Maybe VMS support should be dropped.

2003-06-19 00:10  kps

	* Local.config, src/Makefile.std, src/server/Imakefile,
	  src/server/server.c, src/server/shipshape_s.c: Now Mara's SSHACK
	  is always done, since it seems to work. The idea is that ships
	  are treated in the server as if every ship edge would go in both
	  directions. This means no ships should get stuck inside walls.

2003-06-18 23:47  kps

	* configure.ac, src/common/xpcommon.h: Added more checks for

	  non-paused players as opposed to only paused players.

2003-06-17 23:04  kps

	  special pause "team", if team play is on. Changed gap between
	  teams in scorelist to 1 line from a previous value of 2.

2003-06-17 15:05  kps

	* bootstrap, configure.ac: removed use of config dir, since it did

	* src/client/: configure.c, default.c, guimap.c, guiobjects.c,
	  paint.c, paint.h, xinit.c: Added life colors: zeroLivesColor,
	  oneLifeColor, twoLivesColor, manyLivesColor. Changed *LWColor

	  currently are green for >2 lives, yellow for 2 lives, red for 1
	  life and white for 0 lives. A life color can be set to 0, in this

2003-06-12 09:31  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, command.c, global.h, player.c, server.c:
	  Changed handling of roundstoplay back to the behaviour in 4.5.4.
	  The reason was that setting roundstoplay to 0 at the end of a
	  match with nonzero roundstoplay often results in that if several
	  matches are played, the roundstoplay will likely be 0 in the
	  second match, since people forget to set roundstoplay to nonzero
	  again.  Only change to 4.5.4 behaviour is that game over is done
	  only after round N in a N round match, not at N, N+1, N+2, ... as
	  in 4.5.4.

2003-06-12 08:50  kps

	* src/client/: client.h, configure.c, default.c, painthud.c,

2003-06-11 21:12  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, global.h, walls.c: Removed
	  treatBallAsPoint option, added ballRadius.  Currently ballRadius

2003-06-11 12:50  kps

	* src/client/textinterface.c: Get rid of warning "string length ...

	  event.c, item.c, netserver.c, player.c, proto.h, robot.c,
	  robotdef.c, server.c, ship.c, shot.c, update.c, walls.c: int ind
	  to player *pl changes, fixed netserver.c so that recordings work
	  (i had broken recording mode when i disabled player passwords).
	  Fixed a few places where Pause_player was given and id as first
	  argument (should have been index to player array, now correct way
	  is to give player *).

	  changed int ind argument to player *pl in functions:
	  Handle_keyboard, Pause_player, Place_item, Tractor beam
	  functions, Ecm functions, Do_deflector, Transporter functions,
	  do_lose_item, Explode_fighter, Throw_items, Detonate_items,

	  guiobjects.c, paint.c, paint.h, paintmap.c, xinit.c: Added
	  options team0Color, team1Color, ..., team9Color.  The idea is
	  that if team color is 0, then the old color scheme (white ships
	  for enemies etc) is used. If teamXColor is nonzero, then ships,
	  treasure boxes and targets of team X are drawn in this color.
	  This can be useful at least on maps with more than 2 teams.

	* Local.config: added pedantic compiler flag to gcc ridiculous
	  warning level

2003-06-04 15:33  kps

	* src/server/contact.c: Added variables to decrease number of
	  Players() calls. Other small changes.

2003-06-04 15:25  kps

	* src/server/shot.c: Add player velocity to initial laser position
	  (hack).

2003-06-04 12:26  kps

	* src/server/: metaserver.c, robot.c, tuner.c: Added variables to
	  decrease number of Players() calls.

2003-06-04 12:16  kps

	  Players() calls.

2003-06-04 12:05  kps

	  global.h, item.c, netserver.c, play.c, robotdef.c, server.c,
	  ship.c, shot.c, update.c, walls.c, walls_old.c: Added
	  Player_by_id(id) macro to replace Players(GetInd(id)).

2003-06-03 20:27  kps

	* src/server/: alliance.c, cannon.c, collision.c, command.c,

	  player.c, proto.h, robotdef.c, score.c, server.c, serverconst.h,
	  ship.c, shot.c, update.c, walls.c, walls_old.c: Changed GetInd[]

2003-06-03 12:18  kps

	* src/client/: client.h, configure.c, default.c, guimap.c: Added
	  showExtraBaseInfo option which draws lives/mychar at base.

2003-06-03 10:36  kps

	* src/client/: guimap.c, paintmap.c: Handle both types of base
	  warning in Gui_paint_base().

2003-06-03 08:00  kps

	* src/client/guiobjects.c: Draw lives by ship even if shipNameColor
	  is 0. Other small fixes.

2003-06-03 07:46  kps

	* src/client/guimap.c: remove duplicate code in Gui_paint_base

2003-06-02 17:24  kps

	* src/server/update.c: Check if ship is inside wall when phasing
	  ends added.

2003-05-30 23:44  kps

	* src/server/robotdef.c: Defined pointers to world objects to make
	  some loops more readable.

2003-05-30 23:13  kps

	* src/server/robotdef.c: Changed Check_robot_target() to take click
	  arguments.

2003-05-30 22:36  kps

	* src/server/: cannon.c, frame.c, object.h, objpos.c, robotdef.c,
	  update.c, walls_old.c: Blocks and pixels removed from
	  objposition. Only clicks remain. This means the preferred way to
	  specify coordinates in the server is in clicks. Blocks and pixels
	  can be used, but should be avoided if possible.

2003-05-30 22:35  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: Always set maximum number of points
	  (MAX_SHIP_PTS2) in zeroshape to decrease number of segmentation
	  faults.

2003-05-30 15:48  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: Changes in shape_is_inside: 1. No need to
	  initalise zeroshape if middle point is inside some group.  2.
	  Mara's SSHACK that doubles the number of points in a ships means
	    that shape->num_points can be > MAX_SHIP_PTS. Use
	  shape->num_points    when initialising zeroshape.

	  In fact, at the time of writing I think it would be enough if
	  shape_is_inside would consider only shape->num_orig_points
	  points, which is the amount of points in the shape before SSHACK
	  doubling.

2003-05-30 14:50  kps

	* src/server/update.c: Use shape_is_inside() when looking for
	  hyperjump destination.

2003-05-30 14:46  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: Use HITMASK macro in more places.

2003-05-30 14:41  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: Use HITMASK macro in Turn_player_new.

2003-05-30 13:56  kps

	* src/server/update.c: Changed stuff to use clicks instead of
	  pixels.  Some readablility changes.  One bug fixed: in the
	  warping code, where we have a counter going down from 20 to 0,
	  previouly player block position was used to fill in values in a
	  struct holding pixel positions. Now fixed to use clicks.

2003-05-30 12:53  kps

	* src/server/update.c: code indent

2003-05-30 12:45  kps

	* src/server/: map.h, update.c: Changed wormhole countdown to float

	  update to increase readability.

2003-05-30 12:33  kps

	* src/server/update.c: Update.c changes to improve readability.

2003-05-29 23:39  kps

2003-05-29 01:33  juhal

	* src/: client/paint.h, client/NT/xpilot.rc, common/version.h:
	  changes to make rc10 compile on windows

2003-05-28 23:19  kps

	* src/server/: frame.c, global.h: Added variable frame_loops_slow.
	  This is a "normalized" counterpart to frame_loops, that tries to
	  proceed the same speed if fps is changed.  This means for example
	  radar dots blink at the same frequency at low and at high fps.
	  Currently frame_loops_slow is used for a variety of blinking
	  radar and for hoverpause and autopilot. Probably it should be
	  used in other places too.

2003-05-28 17:58  kps

	* src/server/: walls.h, walls_old.c: Changes for readablility:
	  BounceHorLo -> BounceLeft BounceHorHi -> BounceRight BounceVerLo
	  -> BounceDown BounceVerHi -> BounceUp

2003-05-28 17:25  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: Small changes in handling cannon collisions.

2003-05-28 16:47  kps

	* src/server/play.c: Changed cannon hit function so that nothing
	  ever hits a phased cannon.  Some other changes too.

2003-05-28 16:43  kps

	* src/client/messages.c: Added scanning for messages saying player
	  was killed by cannon fire.

2003-05-27 22:43  kps

	* src/client/: messages.c, paint.c: Basewarning is now not drawn
	  for players that die on last life.  Frequency of flashing things
	  (for example Mara's basewarning) is fixed so that they flash with
	  frequency 12 Hz, if FPS >= 12.

2003-05-27 17:37  kps

	* Local.config, src/Makefile.std, src/server/auth.c,
	  src/server/command.c, src/server/netserver.c: Disabled auth and
	  setpass commands so that crypt is not needed.

	  The commands must be thoroughly tested before they can be
	  re-enabled as there is at least one bug which causes the client
	  to crash if rejoining a server where a password has been set for
	  the joining nick.

2003-05-27 16:21  uau

	* mapconvert.py: Position balls one click higher so they're not
	  inside the wall below.

2003-05-27 11:20  kps

	* src/client/: netclient.c, paint.c, painthud.c, xevent.c: Changed
	  keepalive, key repeat and lose_item_active to use the client fps
	  instead of the setup fps. This should allow the client to adapt
	  when the server fps is changed, because setup fps only tells us
	  what fps the server was running at when the client joined.

2003-05-27 10:54  kps

	* src/client/talk.c: added comment

2003-05-27 10:53  kps

	* src/client/painthud.c: Now draw client fps in hudColor. Setting
	  hudColor to 0 can be used not to draw this.

2003-05-27 09:46  kps

	* src/client/paint.c: Since server can now change FPS on the fly,
	  client can't assume Setup->frames_per_second (FPS) is the current
	  value of FPS.

	  The client now uses clientFPS (the number of frames the client
	  drew last second) for estimating the correct number of frames to
	  do the base warning (the correct time to use for base warning is
	  assumed to be 3 seconds).

	  Also changed max. frequency of blinking for stuff like base
	  warning, score objects etc. to be 20 Hz.

2003-05-27 09:27  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, global.h, walls.c, walls_old.c: Added
	  coriolis support to new move player function. Changed coriolis
	  server option from int to real.  Added initial code to select
	  friction.

2003-05-26 23:51  kps

	* src/server/: collision.c, command.c, player.c, proto.h, rank.h,
	  update.c: Added boolean argument (add_rank_death) to Kill_player
	  and Player_death_reset functions. If this is true the death is
	  counted in ranking. This removes the need for
	  Rank_IgnoreLastDeath.

2003-05-26 23:13  kps

	* src/server/event.c: small simplification in team_dead

2003-05-26 15:55  kps

	* src/: common/rules.h, server/object.h, server/play.c,
	  server/player.c, server/rules.c, server/update.c,
	  server/walls_old.c: Removed WARPED bit from player status. Added
	  a new field warped to the player structure, which tells how long
	  the player will still be in the warped state. The player is no
	  longer in the warped state when this reaches 0. The warped state
	  gives a player immunity to a wormhole just warped to.  Currently
	  the player remains in the warped state for one second.

	  Removed unused wormDrawCount from player structure.

2003-05-26 14:26  kps

	* src/server/play.c: Initial support for warping ships trough
	  polygon wormholes.

2003-05-25 17:50  kps

	* src/server/netserver.c: Tell current value of FPS to joining
	  clients.

2003-05-25 00:59  kps

	* src/server/: play.c, polygon.c, proto.h, xpmap.c: Added initial
	  (not working) Wormhole_hitfunc function.

2003-05-24 14:53  kps

	* src/server/: map.h, play.c, polygon.c, proto.h, walls.c: Changed
	  all hit_mask's to hitmask and hit_func's to hitfunc.

2003-05-24 00:20  kps

	* src/server/shipshape_s.c: sshack support.

2003-05-24 00:10  kps

	* src/: client/shipshape_c.c, common/draw.h, common/shipshape.c:
	  Added back support for SSHACK. Memory for shipobjs is allocated
	  as if SSHACK would always be on.

2003-05-23 23:35  kps

	* src/common/draw.h: Changed shapepos to union.

2003-05-23 23:06  kps

	* src/: client/shipshape_c.c, common/shipshape.c,
	  server/shipshape_s.c: minor changes

2003-05-23 22:27  kps

	* src/: client/shipshape_c.c, common/shipshape.c,
	  server/shipshape_s.c: Moved shape2wire to common.

2003-05-23 22:04  kps

	* src/: client/shipshape_c.c, common/draw.h, common/shipshape.c,
	  server/shipshape_s.c: Moved Rotate_ship, do_parse_shape and
	  Free_ship_shape functions to common.

2003-05-23 21:32  kps

	* src/: client/shipshape_c.c, common/draw.h, common/shipshape.c,
	  server/shipshape_s.c: Convert_ship_2_string is now in common
	  code.  WARNING: SSHACK is currently broken.

2003-05-23 19:50  kps

	* src/: client/shipshape_c.c, common/draw.h, common/shipshape.c,
	  server/shipshape_s.c: added 3 more common shipshape functions

2003-05-23 14:15  kps

	* src/: client/paintobjects.c, client/shipshape_c.c, common/draw.h,
	  server/shipshape_s.c, server/walls.c: Changes so that the shipobj
	  structure is the same both on server and client.  This allows
	  using common functions to handle it. SHIPCOORD define is replaced
	  by shapepos type. Currently the shapepos is a structure, but
	  could be changed to an union.

2003-05-22 14:35  kps

	* src/common/draw.h: fixed a few ship interface macros and added a
	  few

2003-05-22 14:33  kps

	* src/client/guiobjects.c: Changed accesses to shipobj right and
	  left light arrays to use the shipshape interface.

2003-05-22 13:06  kps

	* src/: Makefile.std, client/shipshape_c.c, client/xpilot.c,
	  common/Imakefile, common/draw.h, common/shipshape.c,
	  server/server.c, server/shipshape_s.c: Start to move common
	  shipshape code back to common/shipshape.c.

2003-05-22 13:03  kps

	* src/: server/frame.c, client/painthud.c: removed compiled
	  warnings

2003-05-21 18:12  kps

	* src/server/: walls.c, walls_old.c: Use Ship_get_point_clpos
	  instead of directly accessing shipobj point array.

2003-05-21 15:46  kps

	* src/: common/draw.h, server/frame.c, server/objpos.c,
	  server/robotdef.c, server/ship.c, server/shot.c: Started writing
	  an interface to handle shipshapes. This could possibly also be
	  used for shapes in general. The idea of the interface is to hide
	  the data in the shipobj structure so that changes can be made in
	  the shipshape*.c files. This might allow combining shipshape_c.s
	  and shipshape_s.c back to shipshape.c in the common dir.

2003-05-21 09:43  kps

	* Local.config, src/Makefile.std, src/common/draw.h,
	  src/server/Imakefile, src/server/server.c,
	  src/server/shipshape_s.c: Mara contributed a hack which allows
	  using any shipshape on a polygon map without getting stuck in
	  walls. The idea is to double the number of vertices in the ship,
	  placing an identical copy of the ship on top of itself, only the
	  copy has the vertices given in opposite order. To use it, the
	  server must be compiled with SSHACK defined. Currently SSHACK has
	  been enabled both in Local.config and in Makefile.std.

2003-05-20 16:04  kps

	* src/client/paint.h: Change so that messages will be considered to
	  be new for 15 seconds.  We could possibly add options
	  messagesNewTime and messagesLifeTime.

2003-05-20 16:02  kps

	* src/client/messages.c: removed unused variables

2003-05-20 14:15  kps

	* src/server/walls.c: Fixes in function Bounce_player: added
	  support for armor, improved support for targets.  Removed some
	  unecessary braces here and there.

2003-05-20 12:35  kps

	* README.txt.msub: changed email addr

2003-05-19 23:43  kps

	* src/server/player.c: Removed unused code and some comments.

2003-05-19 23:15  kps

	* src/client/painthud.c: Changes in function drawing hudlock so
	  that if hudColor is 0 nothing is drawn except for the actual
	  hudlock dot. The hudlock dot is drawn only if hudLockColor is
	  nonzero.

2003-05-19 22:49  kps

	* src/: Makefile.std, client/about.c, common/config.c,
	  common/config.h: Changed some more of the xpilot at xpilot.org
	  addresses to my email address so they won't be bothered
	  unecessarily.

2003-05-18 18:40  kps

	* src/client/: default.c, xinit.c: Default option changes: Life
	  Warning not used by default.	All meters except loss meter
	  disabled by default.	Default shotsizes bigger.  Changed default
	  message and old message colors to grey and dark grey.

2003-05-18 01:48  kps

	* src/client/: configure.c, default.c, messages.c, paint.h,
	  painthud.c, xinit.c: New messages are now colored depending on if
	  they are ball, safe, cover or pop messages (if ballMsgScan is
	  on).	Added msgScanSafeColor and msgScanPopColor.

2003-05-17 23:09  kps

	* src/client/: guiobjects.c, guiobjects.h, paintobjects.c: All
	  teamshots are drawn in teamShotColor.  If teamShotColor is 0 then
	  teamshots are not drawn.

2003-05-17 22:50  kps

	* src/client/painthud.c: Fixes so that messages of color 0 are not
	  drawn.

2003-05-17 22:31  kps

	* src/client/: configure.c, default.c, guimap.c, paint.h,
	  paintmap.c, xinit.c: Added backgroundPointColor option.  Hud
	  radar limit border is now drawn for one second when the option is
	  changed.

2003-05-17 21:11  kps

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, global.h, walls.c, walls_old.c: Set
	  fastAim option true by default.  Added testing option
	  maraTurnqueue which can be used to enable Mara's "turnqueue"
	  hack.

2003-05-17 20:50  kps

	* src/client/painthud.c: painthud fixes

2003-05-17 17:46  kps

	* src/client/painthud.c: only draw temporary meters if we have a
	  temporaryMeterColor which is not 0

2003-05-17 17:04  kps

	* src/client/: client.h, configure.c, default.c, netclient.c,
	  paint.h, painthud.c, xinit.c: Changed meter options to color
	  options, added color for temporary meters (for example phasing,
	  emergency shield and power and turnspeed if those colors are 0).
	  Added option for meter border color.

2003-05-17 07:24  uau

	* src/server/walls.c: Simplified code, fixed very rarely occurring
	  bugs. As a side effect things that somehow (erroneously) end up
	  inside a polygon can now exit through the edges, and illegal
	  shipshapes with the wrong side of edge outside will be
	  permanently stuck on map corners.

2003-05-17 00:23  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, configure.c, paint.h,
	  painthud.c, xevent.c: Changed control_count (frames) to
	  controlTime (seconds, DFLOAT).  This affects how long power and
	  turnspeed meters are shown in certain situations.

2003-05-17 00:19  kps

	* src/common/draw.h: removed CONTROL_DELAY

2003-05-16 23:54  kps

	* src/client/: default.c, painthud.c: Changed default hudLockColor
	  to 0 (invisible) and made it independent of hud radar color
	  settings.

2003-05-16 23:52  kps

	* src/server/robot.c: changed new robot delay to DFLOAT so that
	  timeStep can be added to it

2003-05-16 23:26  kps

	* src/common/const.h: removed FUEL_NOTIFY because it is only needed
	  in client

2003-05-16 23:25  kps

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, paint.h, paintdata.c,
	  painthud.c, xevent.c: painthud fixes

2003-05-16 22:43  kps

	* src/client/: configure.c, default.c, guimap.c, guimap.h, paint.h,
	  paintmap.c, xinit.c: added visibilityBorderColor option

2003-05-16 06:04  uau

	* src/server/walls.c: Simplified some code, show a warning about
	  player movement problems

2003-05-16 04:07  uau

2003-05-16 01:46  uau

	* mapconvert.py, src/server/polygon.c, src/server/xp2map.c: Removed
	  the requirement that a map file must have no edges longer than
	  30000 clicks (server now automatically splits long ones)

2003-05-16 01:11  uau

	* src/server/: polygon.c, walls.c: Changed map correctness checks
	  and printed complaints

2003-05-16 01:02  uau

	* src/server/netserver.c: Changed server stdout output a bit

2003-05-16 00:24  uau

	  server/robotdef.c, server/serverconst.h, server/ship.c,
	  server/shot.c, server/update.c, server/walls.c,
	  server/walls_old.c: Removed last integer timings and related
	  variables. Some more things could be converted to floats/doubles,
	  for example fuel stations won't regenerate with FPSMultiplier (no
	  such variable now) > 16 and 1 player because the integer amount
	  per frame rounds to 0.

2003-05-15 17:14  kps

	* src/server/global.h: added extern

	  Something might have broken...

2003-05-15 04:17  uau

	* src/server/cmdline.c: Fixed some option flags, converted more

	  the latter name)

2002-05-21 19:59  tkr

	* src/server/: netserver.c, player.c, rank.c: Server: Moved some
	  code to rank.c (it completely ignores players with a tilde at the

	* src/common/checknames.c: Oops, comment fix.

2002-05-11 18:55  tkr

	* src/common/checknames.c: Just added a comment.

2002-05-11 18:45  tkr

	  dots).

2002-05-11 18:02  tkr

	* src/Makefile.std: Dependencies update.

2002-05-11 17:42  tkr

	* src/server/netserver.c: Minor change.

2002-05-10 20:12  tkr

	* src/server/netserver.c: Command /nick works again if changing
	  only the case of some letters.

2002-05-09 22:32  tkr

	* src/server/netserver.c: Command /nick saves scores only if
	  player's nick doesn't have a ~ (PROT_EXT) suffix. Server doesn't
	  send a reply message if commands set 'msg' to a null string.

2002-05-09 22:25  tkr

	* src/server/player.c: Scores won't be saved for unauthenticated
	  players (i.e. players whose nicks have a ~ (PROT_EXT) suffix).

2002-05-09 16:49  tkr

	* src/server/cmdline.c: Minor change.

2002-05-09 16:45  tkr

	* doc/: CREDITS, ChangeLog: It was time to update the
	  CREDITS/ChangeLog. Still much stuff missing!

2002-05-09 03:29  tkr

	* src/server/netserver.c: Command /nick checks variable
	  alwaysAllowNickCmd and won't change a player's name if the
	  variable is set to false and the player's nick doesn't have the
	  PROT_EXT suffix.

2002-05-09 03:23  tkr

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, global.h: New option/variable
	  alwaysAllowNickCmd.

2002-05-08 22:51  tkr

	* src/server/auth.c: Small fix.

2002-05-08 21:35  tkr

	* src/server/auth.c: Just checking this code in for later debugging
	  (doesn't work).

2002-05-07 23:29  tkr

	* src/server/netserver.c: 'setpass' command checks variable
	  'allowPlayerPasswords'.

2002-05-05 22:47  uau

	* src/server/: play.c, ship.c: Removed debris and wreckage speed
	  limits that interfered with FPSMultiplier.  I don't know what was
	  the reason for these limits to begin with.

2002-05-05 20:47  uau

	* src/: client/welcome.c, server/metaserver.h: Metaserver IP
	  address change

2002-05-01 18:17  tkr

	* src/server/netserver.c: Replaced two "/mypassword" with
	  "/setpass".

2002-05-01 18:10  tkr

	* src/: client/client.c, client/netclient.c, common/pack.h,
	  server/netserver.c: MAGIC fixed.

2002-05-01 17:27  tkr

	* src/server/contact.c: New functions: Queue_is_queued(nick) tests
	  whether a player with this nick is currently queued,
	  Queue_kick(nick) kicks a queued player with this nick.  Fixed two
	  strcmp() to strcasecmp().

2002-05-01 15:34  tkr

	* src/server/netserver.c: PKT_VERIFY: compare nick names, too.
	  Send_player() sends additional %c to indicate that a player is
	  receiving information about himself.

	  Note: When a player authenticated successfully, players with the
	  same nick waiting in the queue will be kicked!

	  Support for player passwords: New functions Conn_change_nick()
	  and Conn_have_nick(). Nicks protected by a password will be
	  modified on login, for example Robert -> Robert~.  New commands
	  /nick and /setpass to allow setting a password (if allowed) and
	  authenticating (or just changing one's nick).

2002-05-01 15:14  tkr

	* src/server/cmdline.c: New options for player passwords support:
	  playerPasswordsFileName (or short -playerPasswordsFile)
	  playerPasswordsFileSizeLimit (-playerPasswordsLimit)
	  allowPlayerPasswords (-PlayerPasswords)

2002-05-01 15:05  tkr

	* src/server/proto.h: New #include and prototypes.

2002-05-01 14:59  tkr

	* src/common/pack.h: New MAGIC because of Send_player() changes.

2002-05-01 14:58  tkr

	* src/common/draw.h: Added #include.

2002-05-01 14:57  tkr

	* src/common/checknames.h: New #define.

2002-05-01 14:36  tkr

	* src/common/checknames.c: 3 changes: 1. The first change requires
	  all nickname/realname/hostname/dispname buffers supplied to this
	  file's functions to point to valid strings (i.e. no uninitialized
	  buffers, zero-terminated). The Check_* and Fix_* functions don't
	  set a NULL character at MAX_*_LEN anymore, because that prevented
	  use of these functions in some contexts. Instead, the Fix_*
	  functions will check whether the string is too long and truncate
	  it in that case. The Check_* functions will just return
	  NAME_ERROR instead of changing anything. 2. Nick names can't have
	  any tildes or colons (~ and :) in them. 3. Removed $Id tag.

2002-05-01 13:53  tkr

	* src/client/painthud.c: Added parentheses to minimize compiler
	  warnings.

2002-05-01 13:41  tkr

	* src/client/xpilot.c: Added include to minimize compiler warnings.

2002-05-01 13:35  tkr

	* src/client/netclient.c: Receive_player() scans new 'myself' flag
	  that servers >= 4.3.1X send.

2002-05-01 01:26  tkr

	* src/client/protoclient.h: Added hostName argument to
	  Parse_options() prototype.

2002-05-01 01:24  tkr

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h: Added 'myself' argument to
	  Handle_player() and code to handle it.

	* src/server/auth.h: For auth.c.

2002-04-30 23:49  tkr

	* src/server/auth.c: This file provides functions for
	  reading/writing/removing and checking player passwords.

	  and auth.o.

2002-04-30 23:26  tkr

	* src/Makefile.std: New VERSION, corrected installation paths,
	  added "depend" and "install-linux" targets and updated
	  dependencies, added auth.c, auth.o, -lz and -lcrypt,
	  CRYPTLIBD/CRYPTINC, EXPATLIBD/EXPATINC, ZLIBD/ZLIBINC, replaced
	  "Makefile.std" with "Makefile" except for the "depend" target.

2002-04-29 23:12  tkr

	* src/common/version.h: Putting version.h back into the repository,
	  but it'd be better if Makefile.std called 'msub' to create it.

2002-04-29 20:53  tkr

	* README.txt, README.txt.msub: Removed reference to contrib/VMS
	  which has been deleted.

2002-04-29 20:41  tkr

	* src/client/NT/XPilot.ini: Path correction.

2002-04-29 20:37  tkr

	* contrib/jxpmap/org/xpilot/jxpmap/defopts: Path correction.

2002-04-29 20:15  tkr

	  /usr/local/...

2002-04-29 20:11  tkr

	* doc/man/xpilot.man.msub: Removed duplicate -name and -team
	  descriptions, changed /usr/local/games/... to /usr/local/...

2002-04-29 19:54  tkr

	* Local.config: Changed path /usr/local/games to /usr/local, added
	  -lcrypt to linker options, new version and copyright date.

2002-04-29 19:43  tkr

	* src/client/xpilot.c: Removed $Id tag

2002-04-29 19:27  tkr

	* src/client/: default.c, xpilot.c: Moved some checks from xpilot.c
	  to default.c, included user/host options.

2002-04-29 17:56  tkr

	* src/client/rplayaudio.c: Cosmetic change.

2002-04-28 23:42  tkr

	* src/client/rplayaudio.c: Replaced strcpy with strlcpy and
	  increased size of 'host' buffer.

2002-04-28 22:58  tkr

	* src/common/socklib.c: Small strncpy() fix.

2002-04-28 22:18  tkr

	* src/client/textinterface.c: Fixed getline() calls.

2002-04-28 21:26  tkr

	* contrib/VMS/: README.VMS, descrip.mms, gettimeofday.c,
	  gettimeofday.h, install.com, ioctl.c, makexp.com, makexps.com,
	  strcasecmp.h, trnlnm.c, username.c, username.h, xp-replay.opt,
	  xp_startup.com, xpilot.hlb, xpilot.opt, xpilots.opt: VMS no
	  longer supported.

2002-04-28 20:57  tkr

	* README.txt: Version and copyright update.

2002-04-28 18:49  tkr

	* src/common/version.h: This file shouldn't be in the repository.

2002-04-28 02:14  uau

	* src/client/painthud.c: Only use the message scan hack functions
	  on old servers

2002-04-28 02:05  uau

	* src/client/: client.c, client.h, guiobjects.c, guiobjects.h,
	  paint.h, painthud.c, paintmap.c: Added warnings for ships
	  appearing on bases. Currently drawn in an ugly way.  Based on
	  Mara's message scan hack, but with major cleanups, fixes and
	  modifications. Currently only works on old servers. Will add
	  server-side support to new servers later, so the ugly message
	  scan hack isn't needed on those.

2002-04-24 21:59  uau

	* src/client/: configure.c, default.c, painthud.c, xinit.c: Changed
	  hrcolor1 default, setting hrcolor1/2, hudlockcolor to 0 now means
	  that hud radar dots or hud lock are not shown.

2002-04-22 02:26  uau

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, collision.c, frame.c, item.c,
	  netserver.c, option.c, player.c, recwrap.c, sched.c, server.c,
	  shipshape.c, srecord.c, walls.c: changed 'errno = 0;
	  error("foo");' pairs to use warn()

2002-04-20 22:42  uau

	* .xpilotrc: removed the sample .xpilotrc, most options should have
	  sensible defaults in the client now

2002-04-19 01:58  uau

	* src/server/walls.c: Fixed a problem that could cause polygons of
	  same height/width to appear one pixel different in the client if
	  their starting point was located differently within the polygon.

2002-04-18 23:36  uau

	* src/client/paintradar.c: Use polygon colors on map if possible,
	  remove apparently unreachable code, reindent Paint_world_radar

2002-04-18 16:02  uau

	* src/server/: collision.c, walls.c: fix for previous change

2002-04-18 02:55  uau

	* Local.config: Removed TurnThrust definition (support removed from
	  code earlier)

2002-04-18 02:55  uau

	* doc/README.rank: Had committed wrong version of this earlier,
	  mentioning nonexistent variable

2002-04-18 02:17  uau

	* src/server/: collision.c, object.h, walls.c: Changed the way
	  analytical object collision detection is done, fixing bugs

2002-04-17 12:22  uau

	* src/server/map.c: print mapsize in pixels instead of (rounded)
	  blocks when starting server

2002-04-16 21:08  tkr

	* src/client/: paintdata.c, painthud.c: Moved some
	  -messagesToStdout code so even more status messages will go to
	  standard output (if set to 2).

2002-04-16 02:21  uau

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, item.c, update.c: FPSMultiplier
	  improvements (fuel drain correction, /set limits)

2002-04-16 01:35  uau

	* src/server/: event.c, netserver.c, object.h, player.c, server.c:
	  removed player structure 'mode' field

2002-04-15 22:18  uau

	* src/client/: client.h, configure.c, default.c, guiobjects.c,
	  paint.h, paintobjects.c, texture.c, texture.h: Removed the
	  texturedBalls option

2002-04-15 21:55  uau

	* src/client/: guimap.c, guiobjects.c, paint.h: Some objects no
	  longer jump around by 1 pixel relative to polygons when
	  scaleFactor is not 1 (and certain other objects still do...).

2002-04-15 20:47  uau

	* src/client/paint.c: Fixed a bug that caused frames to be copied
	  incompletely with scaleFactor < 1 and pixmap copying.

2002-04-15 01:37  uau

	* src/: client/client.c, client/configure.c, server/frame.c,
	  server/netserver.c, server/object.h, server/player.c: Changed the
	  way maxFPS works. Now the client receives every n:th frame, where
	  where n is the smallest integer such that FPS/n <= maxFPS.
	  Changed the limits for allowed maxFPS values in client and
	  server.

2002-04-14 03:35  uau

	* src/: common/const.h, server/collision.c, server/frame.c,
	  server/item.c, server/object.h, server/player.c, server/ship.c,
	  server/shot.c, server/update.c: Make in-game timings independent
	  of FPS (they now always take as many frames as on a 12 FPS
	  server). Fix FPSMultiplier for initial shields.  Remove useless
	  emergency_shield_max field from player structure.

2002-04-14 03:29  uau

	* src/common/commonproto.h: removed declaration for String_hash() -
	  no idea why it was here

2002-04-14 03:07  uau

	* src/: common/const.h, server/cannon.c, server/play.c,
	  server/proto.h, server/ship.c, server/shot.c, server/update.c,

	  Make_debris interface

2002-04-14 02:08  uau

	* src/server/update.c: move math.c prototypes to commonproto.h

2002-04-14 01:48  uau

	* src/: client/default.c, client/protoclient.h,
	  common/commonproto.h, common/math.c, server/cmdline.c,
	  server/item.c, server/map.c, server/proto.h, server/server.c:
	  Moved math.c prototypes to commonproto.h

2002-04-14 00:42  uau

	* src/server/: Imakefile, cannon.c, cannon.h, click.h, cmdline.c,

	  update.c, walls.c, walls.h: removed $Id tags

2002-04-12 00:18  uau

	* src/client/welcome.c: Change meta IP, try both if first only
	  gives a few servers

2002-04-11 22:21  uau

	* src/server/: update.c, walls.c: [no log message]

2002-04-08 17:25  tkr

	  server/play.c, server/player.c, server/proto.h, server/server.c,
	  server/ship.c, server/shot.c, server/update.c, server/walls.c:
	  Changed the way some timings work, more support for
	  FPSMultiplier.  Use '12' instead of 'FPS' in some
	  (gameplay-related) delays, so that changing FPS does not affect
	  what you can do in the game during them.  Fixed some unrelated
	  problems. Debris generation with thrust is most important thing
	  left that should take FPSMultiplier in account.

2002-04-01 09:09  uau

	* src/client/: default.c, guiobjects.c: Turned off bitmapped ships
	  since the image didn't match actual shape.  Changed default value
	  of texturedObjects to "yes".

2002-04-01 09:01  uau

	* src/server/: cmdline.c, global.h, item.c, object.h, player.c,
	  shot.c, update.c, walls.c: Allow modifying more options at
	  runtime, some preparations for (re)implementing FPSMultiplier.
