will be transported back to their homebases.
This option is only effective when limitedLives is turned on.
.HP
\fB\-resetOnHuman\fR or humanReset <integer>
.IP
Normally, new players have to wait until a round is finished
before they can start playing. With this option, the first N
human players to enter will cause the round to be restarted.
In other words, if this option is set to 0, nothing special
happens and you have to wait as usual until the round ends (if
there are rounds at all, otherwise this option doesn't do
anything). If it is set to 1, the round is ended when the first
human player enters. This is useful if the robots have already
started a round and you don't want to wait for them to finish.
If it is set to 2, this also happens for the second human player.
This is useful when you got bored waiting for another player to
show up and have started playing against the robots. When someone
finally joins you, they won't have to wait for you to finish the
round before they can play too. For higher numbers it works the
same. So this option gives the last human player for whom the
round is restarted. Anyone who enters after that does have to
wait until the round is over.
.HP
\-/+allowAlliances or alliances
.IP
Are alliances between players allowed?
Alliances are like teams, except they can be formed and dissolved
at any time. Notably, teamImmunity works for alliances too.

\&'/ally invite <player name>' to invite another player to join you.
\&'/ally cancel' to cancel such an invitation.
\&'/ally refuse <player name>' to decline an invitation from a player.
\&'/ally refuse' to decline all the invitations you received.
\&'/ally accept <player name>' to join the other player.
\&'/ally accept' to accept all the invitations you received.
\&'/ally leave' to leave the alliance you are currently in.
\&'/ally list' lists the members of your current alliance.
If members from different alliances join, all their allies do so.
.HP
\-/+announceAlliances
.IP
Are changes in alliances made public?
If this option is on, changes in alliances are sent to all players
and all alliances are shown in the score list. Invitations for
alliances are never sent to anyone but the invited players.

Make ship move forward at a constant speed when thrust key is held
down, in addition to the normal acceleration. The constant speed
is proportional to the product of the acceleration of the ship
(varying with ship mass and afterburners) and the value of this
option. Note that this option is quite unphysical and can using it
can cause weird effects (with bounces for example).
Low values close to 0.5 (maybe in the range 0.3 to 1) for this
option can be used if you want to increase ship agility without
increasing speeds otherwise. This can improve gameplay for example
on the Blood's Music map. Higher values make the ship behaviour
visibly weird.
