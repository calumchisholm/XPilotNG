===============================================================================

This is a summary of changes of release 4.5.4X compared to release 4.5.4.

===============================================================================

This is a summary of changes of release 4.3.1X compared to release 4.3.1.

An evil buffer overflow bug has been fixed in the server.

VMS is no longer supported since nobody took care of it.
The default installation path has been changed.

Two new client options (user, host). Patch by Paul Alexander Drees. This
allows you to specify the user@host on the command line or in your .xpilotrc.

New client option messagesToStdout for players that want player messages (and
optionally status messages) to go to standard output. (Thorsten Kroeger)

Player passwords support. Several new server options: allowPlayerPasswords
(-PlayerPasswords), playerPasswordsFileName and playerPasswordsFileSizeLimit
(-playerPasswordsFile and -playerPasswordsLimit). Passwords are disabled by
default. Default file name is LIBDIR/player_passwords. Default limit is
1 megabyte (file may grow a little bigger than the limit!). (Thorsten Kroeger)

Regarding the player passwords support, have a look at the new commands
/setpass and /auth.

A minor bug has been fixed that would cause the client not to work properly
if it fixed the nick name at startup. It also wouldn't work correctly with
the newly implemented password support. This fix implies a new MAGIC version.
