FEATURES
========

The xpilot polygon (also known as xpilot upgrade) package includes 
the following differences from official xpilot (xpilot-4.5.4)

General:

	* ./configure builds instead of xmkmf -a - easier to build.

	* .rpm .deb and .tar.gz packages available.
	
	* Full Backward compatibility with older xpilot clients, and
	  servers. (support dropped for xpilot versions prior to 4.2.1).
	
	* Numerous bug fixes, and code cleanups / quality improvement. 

Client:

	* An XPilot client written using SDL and OpenGL - works in 
	  both windows/linux and unix with slick new textures, common
	  code shared with the X11 client.

	* Client options are no longer reliant on X11, option code 
	  completely rewritten so options port cleanly to windows.
	
	* The client has better capabilities for displaying graphics, 
	  and the map format allows specifying different textures and 
	  colors.

	* Improved meta interface on the X11 client.

	* Improved Colour handling and a full colour configuration menu
	  in the client.

	* Server downloadable textures, enabling maps to export their
	  own textures directly to a client.
	
	* Several client improvements, basewarning, toggle off radar
	  and score windows, improved hud, direction pointer.

Server :

	* Total rewriting of the map format - walls and some other 
	  features can now be described as arbitrarily shaped polygons.

	* XML based map descriptions, new xp2 map format. 
	
	* The game speed is no longer tied to the number of frames per 
	  second (FPS). This means that servers can run at higher FPS, 
	  and the game will still proceed at a reasonable rate, giving 
	  a smooth game update.

	* New collision code, collisions are handled properly and ships 
	  cannot get stuck on acute walls anymore.

	* Many new server commands, more server variables can be altered
 	  online such as gamespeed and fps.

	* Players can now spectate without taking up a base whilst 
	  pausing. 

	* Improved precision in thrusting and shooting..

	* Server side recordings - more accurate, and you can review 
	  the recording for any player, much smaller and compact than 
	  the xp-replay recordings.

        * Full integration of teamcup code, run your own xpilot cup.
	
        * Improved ball handling, better collisions, and the ball is no
	  longer treated as a point.

        * better collision detection for laser pulses and shots, added
          an option to make laser pulses bounce off walls.

Tools:

	* A Python map conversion script for converting old style maps 
	  to new style maps.
 
	* A Java map editor for the polygon map format, outputs the map
	  in XML format.
