Note that for each task there is a developer. If you want to work on any of
these tasks, ask that developer first, so you can agree on how to proceed.

SOME TASKS TODO FOR XPILOT NG
-----------------------------

Task: Implement compatibility mode for old clients (block protocol) in server,
when running a polygon map. For this task, one needs to make sure that the
number of map objects (e.g. fuel boxes) in the sent mapdata matches the number
on the map. Note that for checkpoints, some hack might be needed since an
xp2 map can have more than 26 checkpoints, which is the maximum on old maps.
Note also that server migth need to rearrange the map objects so that the old
clients see e.g. the bases in the right order. When this task is done, mapdata
option support can be removed from xp2 maps. Check file src/server/xpmap.c.
Developer: kps

Task: After select based server frame scheduling has been implemented,
implement code that tries to process stuff between frames, so that there is
a minimum amount of stuff todo when the actual frame update is done.
Developer: kps

Task: Change hit area of ships to match the default triangle shipshape. You
need to modify the analytical collision detection code in file
src/server/collision.c. More difficult task would be to write collision
detection code for an arbitrary, possibly a concave shape.
Developer: kps

Task: Make a "physically correct" replacement for the oldthrust hack. This
could possibly be done by adding an emergency thruster that would activate
when the ship has turned. Idea with this is that when ship has turned,
it is assumed the player tries to maneuver, and the emergency thruster
activates automatically. Reason that extra thruster can't be used all the time
is either that it would overheat or that it gets its energy from ship turns :)
Developer: kps

Task: Fix ship maneuverability so that fighting at high fps works as well
or rather better than it used to work on low fps. This should work on all maps,
not just on maps that have oldthrust option not equal to zero etc.
Developer: kps

Task: Make wormholes warp other objects than players.
Developer: kps

Task: Make a newbie friendly default map where newbies can learn the very
basics of the game. The current idea is to make a conversion of new dark hell.
For this task, it would be good if wormholes would work and that cannons
could be made to disappear.
Developer: throat

Task: Server lag should be minimised, ideally so that when the time comes
to send the next frame to the clients, the frame could be sent at once,
or at least so that variance in time between frames is minimised. Possibly
send frame updates earliest to the players with the largets net lag
Developer: kps

Task: Make it so that server uses only 1 or 2 ports. Currently server uses
one contact port and one port per client. In case server is made to use only
one port, that would mean active clients would use that same port for
communication. If server is made to use 2 ports, the contact port would be
reserved for contact stuff and the other port for all clients.
Developer: kps

Task: Fix server recordings. Currently there are 3 problems. Firstly, the
ngsteering option which makes thrust use the ship's floating point direction
instead of one of 128 directions breaks the recording, since it doesn't store
the floating point direction. Second, the server recodings are not robust.
In a test game with 6 players, the replay of the recording only worked about
10 minutes. Thirdly, the recording should be put behind some interface so
that it doesn't mess up the code too much.
Developer: kps

Task: Fix elimination race mode and clean up the race related code.
Developer: kps

Task: Make a new polygon based race map.
Developer: kps

Task: Write robot code that can control robots on a race map.
Developer: kps

Task: Rewrite robot navigation so that it isn't block based.
Developer: kps

Task: Rewrite smart missile navigation so that it isn't block based.
Developer: kps

Task: Make it so that one can unpause in games with baselesspausing
without needing to write a team command.
Developer: kps

Task: Find out if xpilot 4.5.4 has better ship steering than ng. Some
players have reported this. Possibly it is just because of "client lag".
Developer: kps

Task: Remove bottlenecks in server. This means using a profiler and trying
to find ways to speed up processing in places where the server uses a lot
of time.
Developer: kps

Task: Make it so that one can use -list command in client even if X is not
running.
Developer: kps

Task: Add code that handles the case when some map object reappears on top
of some object. This can happen for example when a destroyed cannon reappears.
Developer: kps

Task: Add support for more map objects in mapconvert.py. Also possibly add
a default texture file for these converted maps.
Developer: kps

Task: Improve audio support. Add support for "3D" sound where info about
the sound sources' positions and velocities are sent to clients so that
stuff like Doppler effect can be done. Note that there should be some
uncertainty (noise) in the positions and velocities so that this info can't
be used to make an automatic targetting system.
Developer: kps

Task: Improve newbie mode, for example automatically change scale factor
so that the whole visible area is seen if screen resolution is small.
Developer: kps

Task: Team / base specific starting items / options. This could be used to
make a polygon version of the Predators vs Marines map. Check
http://groups.google.ca/groups?q=predators+xpilot&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&scoring=r&selm=4iu3mg%2462t%40oban.cc.ic.ac.uk&rnum=1
Developer: kps

Task: Client side prediction, which could be used to reduce lag a bit, possibly
even allowing local style ship control.
Developer: kps

Task: Turn the item images on the hud in sdl client the right way (upside down
atm)

Task: Add support for MinGW/MSys build environment and making console 
server work under Windows
Developer: marvn
